## Introduction
* Thanks to the recent unprecedented success of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETC), the alternative cryptocurrency market is seeing a rapid free-for-all.
Both old and new altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than BTC) are garnering more and more support as individuals catch the cryptocurrency craze. 
Social media platforms are ablaze with posts speculating what the next best coin is and how you need to invest now to make it big!
But how much of this is talk is just hype?
Within my project, I analyzed 21 cryptocurrencies' Twitter activity and market performance from the start of 2021 to the end of April 2021 to 
determine whether or not the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ daily price momentum can be predicted via Twitter activity.
